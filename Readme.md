# Tetris

This assignment is optional!

The bonus assignment is very free-form, in contrast to the other assignments. We want you to impress us. You hand in another version of Snake or Tetris (or both) with additional features. You can also hand-in another game or demo instead, or in addition to Snake and/or Tetris. In total, you can get 2 points for this assignment, making the maximum number you can get for the practical a 11, and the maximum you can get for the entire course a 10.5 (actual VU grade is capped at 10).

Your grade mainly depends on how impressed we are with the functionality of your program. We can deduct 1/3 of the points based on code style. So if you submitted something which would get a 7 based on the impressiveness of functionality, you will get only 4.6 if the code is horrific. We will not fully check your code using the style guide, instead we will sample bits of your code and check if names make sense, functions are not too long etc.

Note that this project can share code with Assignment 2.3 and/or 3, but it does not have to, it can be an entirely different project. This is due to the different goals for both assignments: for Assignments 1,2,3 and 4 the code should implement as little as possible (no extra functionality) so that we can compare the implementations between students as fairly as possible. For the Bonus Assignment however, we want an implementation with  as much bells and whistles as possible.

In contrast to other assignments, you may adopt the game drawing/event handling code for Snake/Tetris. This uses the processing library, the documentation of which can be found at [https://processing.org/reference/Links to an external site.](https://processing.org/reference/).

You can do whatever project you want (it does not have to be a game), as long as:

-   It has to use processing (not another game/graphics library, this would make it hard to compare).
-   It has to be visual (i.e. it should lend itself for demonstration in a video/images, like the showcases of previous years.

Describe what you have implemented and how to run it in a Readme.txt file included in\
your project.

 **Required**:

-   Describe what you have implemented and how to run it in a Readme.txt file included in your project.
-   Add two screenshots of your project for inclusion in the showcase (see previous showcases). You can replace one of the screenshots with a movie if you want to show your project in action. The movie is either an .mkv files that you upload to codegrade or put somewhere where we can download it (put a link in readme) OR upload a video to <https://video.vu.nl/>   (put a link in readme). If you want to record a video, we recommend the open source and free software [OBS StudioLinks to an external site.](https://obsproject.com/), available for Linux, Mac and Windows.
